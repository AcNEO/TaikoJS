# TaikoJS
A FOSS Taiko no Tatsujin simulator for browsers.

## WARNING, THE CODE IS VERY MESSY AND MOSTLY UNCOMMENTED.

This is a Taiko no Tatsujin simulator I've been working on for my CS class. It's in Javascript cause... well, I frankly had no other choice. :P Feel free to assist with further development, but I do plan on moving over to Monogame after, so this project will probably end up being abandoned.
